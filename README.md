This repo is currently used a learning platform
about using rust to control an arduino nano 33 iot. 

There already exists good libraries out there of which
I'm trying to learn from and here is such place for
the learning. 


# Running tests

Create a test-runner.bat file (if on windows), this will be called
when running cargo test from within the self-tests directory

these test will be ran on the arduino-nano directly, the led will blink if a test fails.
